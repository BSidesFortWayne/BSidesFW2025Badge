  - 
- 

- Design artifacts
  - [ ] User flows
  - [ ] Initial programming flowchart
  - [ ] Software startup routines
  - [ ] Smart Config Architecture
- Software
  - [x] App Directory
    - [x] Clean up app directory
  - [ ] Base App
    - [ ] 
  - [ ] Controller
    - [ ] Add error screen/error logging to app loading
  - [ ] UI
    - [ ] Make loading/pop up screen design for any views to use
    - [ ] Normalize rendering around async?
      - [ ] Have options for popups, confirmation dialogs, multi choice selections, etc
      - [ ] "Modal" contexts
    - [ ] Network
      - [ ] Add option to connect to local network
      - [ ] Add option to set up in station mode and display QR code
      - [ ] Make simple HTTP server construct (for a module to listen for a specific URL/port?)
- Hardware improvements
  - [x] Add button listeners for press, release, and click
  - [x] Add high level config for hardware version (no point to waste v1 hardware, and then we can share code more easily)
  - [x] Implement IO expander support in `buttons` module (not sure if it needs to just be polled or if we want to make it interrupt driven...)
  - [x] Implement standalone `led` module and add some convenience function
  - [x] Battery meter hardware support?
    - [ ] Battery monitor screen/utility
  - [x] Add accelerometer hardware module
  - [ ] System monitor utility (RAM, storage, etc)
  - [x] Add speaker module
    - [ ] MIDI transforms?
  - [ ] Better display functions
  - [ ] Frame buffer based driver module
  - [ ] LED bug
  - [ ] Test Suite
    - [ ] Speaker driver test (async background?)
  - [ ] MicroPython RTC support?
  - [ ] Low power mode for all day badge usage
- Refactors
  - [x] Make a base `hardware` class that gets called back regularly on the main thread for polling reasons
  - [x] Redesign base `view` concept into `apps` and make `views` class into `controller` for better variable naming/lack of confusion
  - [x] Migrate some hardware setup to `boot.py` for better REPL usage (Dependent on v1/v2 hardware switching)
  - [x] Figure out how to add stubs for better type hint support (I added more `#type: ignore` where appropriate to get better static checking help in VSCode)
- Display
  - [x] QR code generator/displayer
    - [x] [https://github.com/JASchilz/uQR](https://github.com/JASchilz/uQR)
  - [ ] Better abstraction functions/color functions
  - [ ] Make frame buffer based display class for driver abstraction
  - [ ] Dissolve/transitions between images?
    - [ ] General animation function between frame buffers
  - [ ] Ingest / transform image from user?
    - [ ] Zoom/rotate (for final image tweaks?)
    - [ ] Part of badge config
- Performance
  - [ ] Investigate increasing performance in underlying gc9a01 driver in base image/coming up with custom BSides base image
  - [ ] Initial programming could then happen via image load + config file
- Bluetooth
  - Detect BLE beacons?
    - CTF/special prize?
- User configurability
  - Add default `config` options object that can be serialized by app name and then edited via web GUI
  - Add base functionality to `App` base class which handles serialization/deserialization
  - Stored in `config/{module_name}/{app_name}/config.json`
- App Ideas
  - [ ] Badge Modes
    - [ ] Large First + Last Name
    - [ ] Images on both screen
    - [ ] QR mode for contact info

  - [ ] Surface level based on x/y position
  - [ ] Reaction timer game
    - [ ] Multi-player network reaction game
  - [ ] On board image manipulation
    - [ ] Rotate
    - [ ] Zoom
