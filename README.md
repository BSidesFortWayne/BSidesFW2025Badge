This is able to display an image on both of the displays, and turn on the 4 lights next to the displays. It has some problems though. Either the library I am using is inefficient, another processor needs to be used, or both. Right now, it takes ~10 seconds to draw an image on one of the displays. I initially was using the library, [TFT_eSPI](https://github.com/Bodmer/TFT_eSPI). This library worked fine, except the DC, and RST pins for both the displays should be connected in parallel instead of being assigned individual GPIO pins. This will be fixed in version 2 of the board. TFT_eSPI does not support multiple displays, but in the setup I described, it can work by setting the CS pin to high for the display you want to draw to. I was able to get the TFT_eSPI library working for 1 display, which did work faster, but I never tested drawing an image. TFT_eSPI can also be used with [LVGL](https://lvgl.io). Right now, it is using the library, [Adafruit GFX](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-GFX-Library).
